description: >
  Developed intelligent orchestration mechanisms for automating slice admission control and VNF embedding
  in 5G networks. Leveraged multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), graph neural networks,
  and constrained optimization to improve scalability, fairness, and QoS guarantees.
