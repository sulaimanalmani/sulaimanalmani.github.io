I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Systems and Networking Group](https://syn.uwaterloo.ca/) Group at the University of Waterloo, working with Prof. Raouf Boutaba. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan, in 2019, and joined Waterloo in 2020 for a Master of Mathematics (MMath) in Computer Science before transferring to the Ph.D. program.

My research focuses on 5G and beyond networks, AI-driven network management and orchestration, and software-defined networking. I am particularly interested in applying reinforcement learning and optimization techniques to build autonomous management systems for next-generation mobile networks. My work has been recognized with nominations for the IEEE/IFIP NOMS Best Paper Award in 2022 and 2023.
